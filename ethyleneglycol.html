                    <p class="section-text">
                        Ethylene glycol, also known as ethane-1,2-diol, is a simple organic compound with the chemical
                        formula C2H6O2. It is a colorless, odorless, and sweet-tasting liquid that is commonly used as
                        an antifreeze in automotive cooling systems and as a precursor in the production of polyester
                        fibers and resins. Ethylene glycol is a diol, meaning it has two hydroxyl (OH) groups, and it is
                        a critical industrial chemical due to its versatility in various applications.

                                Ethylene glycol is traditionally prepared through the hydration of ethylene oxide, a
                                reaction that involves high-temperature and pressure conditions. Ethylene oxide reacts
                                with water in the presence of a strong acid or base catalyst to form ethylene glycol.
                                This process is energy-intensive and generates substantial waste, making it
                                environmentally unfriendly.

                                The traditional method of preparing ethylene glycol involves the addition of water to
                                ethylene oxide, a chemical reaction that typically occurs at temperatures around 150Â°C
                                and high pressures. The reaction is catalyzed by either a strong acid, such as sulfuric
                                acid, or a strong base, like sodium hydroxide. The outcome of this reaction is a mixture
                                of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and various byproducts.

                                One of the main disadvantages of the traditional method for preparing ethylene glycol is
                                its energy-intensive nature and the generation of significant waste byproducts.
                                Additionally, the use of strong acids or bases as catalysts can pose environmental and
                                safety concerns. These factors make the conventional production process less sustainable
                                and more harmful to the environment.

                                various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These catalysts enable the reaction to proceed
                                at lower temperatures and pressures, reducing energy consumption and minimizing waste

                                Lower temperatures and pressures are employed, which significantly reduce energy

                                Ethylene glycol has a wide range of applications, with its primary use being as an
                                antifreeze in automotive cooling systems. It prevents freezing and overheating of
                                engines by lowering the freezing point and raising the boiling point of water.
                                Additionally, ethylene glycol is utilized in the manufacture of polyester fibers,
                                resins, and various industrial processes where its properties as a versatile solvent and
                                chemical intermediate are valuable. It also finds applications in the pharmaceutical and
